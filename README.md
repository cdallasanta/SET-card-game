Set! The family game of visual perception by SET Enterprises.
=================

*Outdated readme, this is from the old version pre-React*

How to play
-----------
A SET is three cards where each feature, when looked at individually, is either all the same OR all different. Each card contains four features: color (red, purple or green), shape (oval, squiggle or diamond), number (one, two or three) and shading (solid, striped or outlined).
